> The objective of CS101 is to teach *programming skills* and *computational thinking*. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.

#### [Lectures] 
- Starting from Fall 2nd, there will be an **offline lecture** each week in English at E3 and E11. 
- We will take your picture in each lecture, and you should submit the survey by finding your number on the picture. Details are on [Elice](https://kaist.elice.io/courses/)

#### [Lab Sessions] 
- Students must join lab sessions offline at Creative Learning Building (E11).
- Students who cannot join lab sessions offline may join online with the TA's permission.
- The head TA will lecture at the beginning of each lab session.
- Then, the students should do the programming practice with the TAs. Please follow the instructions that will be given at the first lab lecture.
- Please check the detailed instructions posted on the bulletin board at the KLMS site to enroll for the Elice system. [KAIST CS101 @ Elice (2024 Fall)](https://kaist.elice.io/courses/).
- Once you log into the Elice system, please check the announcement board regularly for information about the course.

### Course Objective
The objective of CS101 is to teach _programming skills_ and _computational thinking_. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.
 
### Course Structure
Starting from spring 2010, CS101 uses the programming language **Python**, a language that was designed to be easy to learn. Python is used by many universities world-wide for *teaching introductory programming*. It is free, open-source, and multi-platform.
 
*Python is not a toy*. Python is the basis for much of the programming at Google (for instance, Python is the original and main framework for the Google App Engine platform). Python is used intensively in numerical computations, for instance at NASA. The *numerical Python* library supports vectorization and is widely used in scientific computation. Python is also the language of choice for writing user interfaces for applications on high-end Nokia phones. Large portions of games (such as Civilization IV) are written in Python. Python is becoming the language of choice in mathematics, used for instance by graph algorithm libraries, or the open-source mathematics software system Sage (an open-source competitor to Maple or Mathematica).
 
**Section and Lecture.** CS101 consists of about 500 students. All sections take offline lectures, which is once a week for 60~120 minutes. In addition, the Korean version of the CS101 lectures is available in KOOC (KAIST Massive Open Online Courses): https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101. These lectures would be helpful for those who have difficulties in taking the English lectures.

**Lab Session.** Each section meets once a week for a *three-hour lab session* supervised by a *head TA*, with some *helper TA*'s around. 
Students need to attend the lab session every week. One of the tasks done during the lab has to be marked off by a TA, so that we know that you were there and did your best.
 
**Homework.** There will also be four take-home assignments where you have to program slightly more complex tasks.
  
**Elice.** We will also make use of the online programming education platform, [Elice](https://kaist.elice.io/courses/). Elice contains lecture notes, codes, slides, programming tasks, and exams for CS101.<br>**We will not use KLMS**

**Course Website.** The comprehensive course website (http://cs101.kaist.ac.kr/) contains the syllabus and links to all the software you need in the labs (or to do the lab tasks on your own computer).
All other information, such as professors, TAs, and schedules can be found on the course website as well.

### Grading
CS101 grading consists of two parts: practice and theory.
 
Practice points are collected as follows:
- 100 points for lecture attendance
- 100 points for lab work
- 100 points for homework

Students need to collect at least 250 practice points. Only the students who scored 340~400 practice points are entitled to be graded. Students who did not earn 250 practice points receive a fail grade.
 
Theory points are collected as follows:
- Midterm exam - 40%
- Final exam - 60%

**The final score for CS101 is determined entirely by the theory points.**

**You may get an F if you fail to get enough theory points.**

**The practice points over 250 are ONLY qualifications for grading.**

**Cheating is strongly forbidden.** Cheating on homework or exams will give an F. Both the copier and source provider will obviously get an F grade. **Note that if you look at another’s HW program code, it will be considered cheating.**

**Using ChatGPT or AI-assisted tools will be considered cheating.** If you use any of the IDEs that contain AI-assistant programming tools, you will get an F grade.

Every student will receive a letter grade (A-F).

### Pass exam
In the first week of the semester, we offer a "Pass Exam," which students who have already learned programming can take to fulfill the CS101 requirement.

The pass exam consists of a 120-minute programming exam that covers programming in Python as taught in CS101 but without the cs1robots, cs1media, and cs1graphics modules.

The programming exam is open book and open google. You will use a computer in the lab room.
If you pass the exam with a B- or better, you can choose to accept the score as your CS101 score or to give up the score and take the CS101 course.
You can find more information about the pass exam on the KAIST portal’s announcement board:
[2024 Spring Course Waiver Exam](https://portal.kaist.ac.kr/ennotice/student_notice/11707186901875).
According to the KAIST rule from ART, **only those who have never taken the CS101 can apply for the waiver exam.**

For the 2024 spring semester, we will have a waiver exam on 3/5 at 7 PM on Tuesday at E11 Creative Bldg. 307.

### Repeating students (Course retake policy)
Students who have already taken advanced courses involving programming and all students who are majoring in the following departments cannot retake CS101 if they have already passed CS101: School of Electrical Engineering, School of Computing, Information & Communications Engineering, and Industrial & Systems Engineering.

All repeating students cannot receive a grade better than A- by KAIST policy.

### Literature
CS101 uses the following materials:
-	**Practical Programming**: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6 (3rd Edition) by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, and Jason Montojo, Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2017, ISBN 978-1680502688
    -	A Korean translation is also available (ISBN 978-8960771338)
-	**Robot lecture notes** Lecture notes to be used together with cs1robots.py.
-	**Photo processing lecture notes** Lecture notes to be used with cs1media.py.
-	**Tutorial for cs1graphics** (The original is [http://www.cs1graphics.org/](http://www.cs1graphics.org/).)

The slides used in the lectures will also be available online, and there will be slides for every lab session.
 
### Software
We will use the following freely available software: Python 3, PyCharm IDE, Python Imaging Library (Pillow), cs1graphics.py, cs1robots.py, and cs1media.py.
