> The objective of CS101 is to teach programming skills and computational thinking. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.

#### [Online Lectures] 
- Starting from September 7th, there will be a live, online lecture session each week in English via Zoom. Please check the Elice system to join the online lectures.
- All students must join the first lecture on September 7th via Zoom. Starting from the second lecture, students who prefer to take the lectures in Korean can enroll for the KOOC CS101 course that is available at https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101 instead of joining the Zoom lectures.
- Your attendance will be checked when you join the live Zoom lecture on the lecture day or finish watching the KOOC lecture by 12:30pm on the lecture day.

#### [Online Lab Sessions] 
- At the beginning of each lab session, students need to login to the Elice system and watch the pre-recorded lab lecture.
- Then, the students should do the programming practice online with the TAs. Please follows the instructions that will be given at the first lab lecture.
- Before September 7th, please check the detail instructions that are posted on the bulletin board at the KLMS site to enroll for the Elice system ([Elice CS101 2020 Fall](https://kaist.elice.io/courses/4782)).
- Once you login in to the Elice system, please check the announce board regularly to get information about the course.

### Course Objective
The objective of CS101 is to teach _programming skills_ and _computational thinking_. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.
 
### Course Structure
Starting from spring 2010, CS101 uses the programming language **Python**, a language that was designed to be easy to learn. Python is used by many universities world-wide for teaching introductory programming. It is free, open-source, and multi-platform.
 
_Python is not a toy_. Python is the basis for much of the programming at Google (for instance, Python is the original and main framework for the Google App Engine platform). Python is used intensively in numerical computations, for instance at NASA. The _numerical Python_ library supports vectorization and is widely used in scientific computation. Python is also the language of choice for writing user interfaces for applications on high-end Nokia phones. Large portions of games (such as Civilization IV) are written in Python. Python is becoming the language of choice in mathematics, used for instance by graph algorithm libraries, or the open-source mathematics software system Sage (an open-source competitor to Maple or Mathematica).
 
**Sections and Lectures.** CS101 consists of 10 sections of about 45 students each. Two sections take one lecture together, which is once a week for 60~120 minutes. 

**Lab Sessions.** Each section meets once a week for a three-hour lab session supervised by a head TA (a Ph.D. student), with some helper TA's around (undergraduate and master students). 
Students need to attend the lab session every week. One of the tasks done during the lab has to be marked off by a TA, so that we know that you were there and did your best.
Some of the lab sessions will introduce students how to do pair programming.
 
**Homeworks.** There will also be four take-home assignments where you have to program slightly more complex tasks.
  
**Elice.** We will also make use of the online programming education platform, [Elice](https://kaist.elice.io/courses/4782).

**Course Website.** The comprehensive course website (http://cs101.kaist.ac.kr/) contains the syllabus, lecture notes, and slides for CS101, and links to all the software you need in the labs (or to do the lab tasks on your own computer).
All other information, such as lecturers, TAs, lecture and lab times, homework assignments, exams, and the bulletin boards can be found on the course website http://cs101.kaist.ac.kr/.

### (Optional) CS101 On-line Lectures in KOOC (Kaist massive Open Online Course)
You can register and watch the on-line CS101 lectures in KOOC 
-	[https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101](https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101)
    - The on-line CS101 lectures can help those who have difficulties in CS101
-	The on-line lectures provide detailed visual explanations.
-	You can repeatedly watch videos until you understand.
-	The on-line lectures are taught in Korean (한글강의).  

### Grading
CS101 grading consists of two parts: practice and theory.
 
Practice points are collected as follows:
- 100 points for lecture attendance
- 100 points for lab work
- 200 points for homework

Students need to collect at least 340 practice points. Only the students who scored 340~400 practice points are entitled to be graded. Students who did not earn 340 practice points receive a fail grade
 
Theory points are collected as follows:
- Homework - 10%
- Midterm exam - 40%
- Final exam - 50%

**The final score for CS101 is determined entirely by the theory points.**

**You may get F if you failed to get enough theory points.**

**The practice points over 340 are ONLY qualification for grading.**

**Cheating is strongly forbidden.**

Cheating on homework or exams will give an F. 
Both copier and source provider will obviously get F grade.

**Note that if you look at other’s HW program code, it will be considered as cheating.**

Every student may receive letter grades (A-F), but will be allowed to choose S/U grading afterward.

### Pass exam
In the first week of the semester, we offer a "Pass Exam", which students who have already learnt programming can take to fulfill the CS101 requirement. 
The pass exam consists of a 90 minutes written exam, followed by a 90 minutes programming exam. 
The written exam is closed book, and covers programming in Python as taught in CS101, but without the _cs1robots, cs1media, and cs1graphics_ modules. 
The programming exam is open book (only printed material). You will use a computer in the lab room, but will have access only to the PyCharm or IDLE environment (no internet access). 
If you pass the exam with a B- or better, you can choose to accept the score as your CS101 score, or to give up the score and take the CS101 course.


### Repeating students (Course retake policy)
Students who have already taken advanced courses involving programming, and all students who are majoring in the following departments cannot retake CS101 if they have already passed CS101: School of Electrical Engineering, School of Computing, Information & Communications Engineering, and Industrial & Systems Engineering)
 
All repeating students cannot receive a grade better than A- by KAIST policy (and this applies even to students who entered KAIST before 2007).
  
### Literature
CS101 uses the following materials:
-	**Practical Programming**: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6 (3rd Edition) by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, and Jason Montojo, Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2017, ISBN 978-1680502688
    -	A Korean translation is also available (ISBN 978-8960771338)
-	**Robot lecture notes** Lecture notes to be used together with cs1robots.py.
-	**Photo processing lecture notes** Lecture notes to be used with cs1media.py.
-	**Tutorial for cs1graphics** (The original is [http://www.cs1graphics.org/](http://www.cs1graphics.org/).)

The slides used in the lectures will also be available online, and there will be slides for every lab session.
 
### Software
We will make use of the following freely available software: Python 3, PyCharm IDE, Python Imaging Library (Pillow), cs1graphics.py, cs1robots.py, and cs1media.py.
