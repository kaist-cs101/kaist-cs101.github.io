> The objective of CS101 is to teach programming skills and computational thinking. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.

### Course Objective
The objective of CS101 is to teach programming skills and computational thinking. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.
 
### Course Structure
Starting from spring 2010, CS101 uses the programming language Python, a language that was designed to be easy to learn. Python is used by many universities world-wide for teaching introductory programming. It is free, open-source, and multi-platform.
 
Python is not a toy. Python is the basis for much of the programming at Google (for instance, Python is the original and main framework for the Google App Engine platform). Python is used intensively in numerical computations, for instance at NASA. The numerical Python library supports vectorization and is widely used in scientific computation. Python is also the language of choice for writing user interfaces for applications on high-end Nokia phones. Large portions of games (such as Civilization IV) are written in Python. Python is becoming the language of choice in mathematics, used for instance by graph algorithm libraries, or the open-source mathematics software system Sage (an open-source competitor to Maple or Mathematica).
 
CS101 consists of 9 sections of about 45 students each. Each section meets once a week for a three-hour lab session supervised by a head TA (a Ph.D. student), with some helper TA's around (undergraduate and master students). Two sections take one lecture together, which is once a week for 60~120 minutes.
 
Students need to attend the lab session every week. One of the tasks done during the lab has to be marked off by a TA, so that we know that you were there and did your best.
 
There will also be four take-home assignments where you have to program slightly more complex tasks.
 
Lab sessions will introduce students to pair programming.

### Project-based Learning Section Z
We have a project-based learning section Z which has different course structure and grading policy. Students in Section Z will learn by practicing programming and active discussion during class. This section will teach different course material and will be taught in Korean.  

Students can register Section Z in the first week of 2019 Spring semester.  Note that Section Z is designed to teach students who do not have programming background. We highly recommend students to register Section Z and to involve in active learning.

For more detail, please see the CS101 syllabus of Section Z.

[Syllabus (Section Z)](https://cs101z.page.link/syllabus)

### (Optional) CS101 On-line Lectures in KOOC (Kaist massive Open Online Course)
You can register and learn the on-line CS101 lectures in KOOC 
-	[https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101](https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101)
    - The on-line CS101 lectures can help those who have difficulties in CS101
-	The on-line lectures provide detailed visual explanations.
-	You can repeatedly watch videos until you understand.
-	The on-line lectures are taught in Korean (한글강의).  

### Grading
CS101 grading consists of two parts: practice and theory.
 
Practice points are collected as follows:
- 100 points for lecture attendance
- 100 points for lab work
- 200 points for homework

Students need to collect at least 340 practice points. Only the students who scored 340~400 practice points are entitled to be graded. Students who did not earn 340 practice points receive a fail grade
 
Theory points are collected as follows:
- 100 points for midterm exam.
- 100 points for final exam.

The final score for CS101 is determined entirely by the theory points.

### Repeating students (Course retake policy)
Students who have already taken advanced courses involving programming, and all students who are majoring in the following departments cannot retake CS101 if they have already passed CS101: School of Electrical Engineering, School of Computing, Information & Communications Engineering, and Industrial & Systems Engineering)
 
All repeating students cannot receive a grade better than A- by KAIST policy (and this applies even to students who entered KAIST before 2007).
 
Cheating is strongly forbidden. Cheating on homework or exams will give an F. Both copier and source provider will obviously get F grade. Note that if you look at other’s HW program code, it will be considered as cheating.
  
### Literature
CS101 uses the following materials:
-	**Practical Programming**: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6 (3rd Edition) by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, and Jason Montojo, Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2017, ISBN 978-1680502688
    -	A Korean translation is also available (ISBN 978-8960771338)
-	**Robot lecture notes** Lecture notes to be used together with cs1robots.py.
-	**Photo processing lecture notes** Lecture notes to be used with cs1media.py.
-	**Tutorial for cs1graphics** (The original is [http://www.cs1graphics.org/](http://www.cs1graphics.org/).)

The slides used in the lectures will also be available online, and there will be slides for every lab session.
 
### Software
We will make use of the following freely available software: Python 3, PyCharm IDE, Python Imaging Library (Pillow), cs1graphics.py, cs1robots.py, and cs1media.py.

We will also make use of the online programming education platform, Elice.
