> The objective of CS101 is to teach programming skills and computational thinking. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.

#### [Online Lectures] 
- Starting from March 2nd, there will be a live, online lecture session each week in English via Zoom. Please check the Elice system to join the online lectures.
- All students must join the first lecture on March 2nd via Zoom. Starting from the second lecture, students who prefer to take the lectures in Korean can enroll for the KOOC CS101 course that is available at https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101 instead of joining the Zoom lectures.
- Your attendance will be checked when you join the live Zoom lecture on the lecture day or finish watching the KOOC lecture by 12:30pm on the lecture day.

#### [Online Lab Sessions] 
- At the beginning of each lab session, students need to login to the Elice system and watch the pre-recorded lab lecture.
- Then, the students should do the programming practice online with the TAs. Please follows the instructions that will be given at the first lab lecture.
- Before March 2nd, please check the detail instructions that are posted on the bulletin board at the KLMS site to enroll for the Elice system [KAIST CS101 @ Elice (2021 Spring)](https://kaist.elice.io/courses/7951/).

### Course Objective
The objective of CS101 is to teach _programming skills_ and _computational thinking_. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.
 
### Course Structure
Starting from spring 2010, CS101 uses the programming language **Python**, a language that was designed to be easy to learn. Python is used by many universities world-wide for teaching introductory programming. It is free, open-source, and multi-platform.
 
_Python is not a toy_. Python is the basis for much of the programming at Google (for instance, Python is the original and main framework for the Google App Engine platform). Python is used intensively in numerical computations, for instance at NASA. The _numerical Python_ library supports vectorization and is widely used in scientific computation. Python is also the language of choice for writing user interfaces for applications on high-end Nokia phones. Large portions of games (such as Civilization IV) are written in Python. Python is becoming the language of choice in mathematics, used for instance by graph algorithm libraries, or the open-source mathematics software system Sage (an open-source competitor to Maple or Mathematica).
 
**Sections and Lectures.** CS101 consists of 10 sections of about 45 students each. Two sections take one lecture together, which is once a week for 60~120 minutes. 

**Lab Sessions.** Each section meets once a week for a three-hour lab session supervised by a head TA (a Ph.D. student), with some helper TA's around (undergraduate and master students). 
Students need to attend the lab session every week. One of the tasks done during the lab has to be marked off by a TA, so that we know that you were there and did your best.
Some of the lab sessions will introduce students how to do pair programming.
 
**Homeworks.** There will also be four take-home assignments where you have to program slightly more complex tasks.
  
**Elice.** We will also make use of the online programming education platform, [Elice](https://kaist.elice.io/courses/7951).

**Course Website.** The comprehensive course website (http://cs101.kaist.ac.kr/) contains the syllabus, lecture notes, and slides for CS101, and links to all the software you need in the labs (or to do the lab tasks on your own computer).
All other information, such as lecturers, TAs, lecture and lab times, homework assignments, exams, and the bulletin boards can be found on the course website http://cs101.kaist.ac.kr/.

### (Optional) CS101 On-line Lectures in KOOC (Kaist massive Open Online Course)
You can register and watch the on-line CS101 lectures in KOOC 
-	[https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101](https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101)
    - The on-line CS101 lectures can help those who have difficulties in CS101
-	The on-line lectures provide detailed visual explanations.
-	You can repeatedly watch videos until you understand.
-	The on-line lectures are taught in Korean (한글강의).  

### Grading
CS101 grading consists of two parts: practice and theory.
 
Practice points are collected as follows:
- 100 points for lecture attendance
- 100 points for lab work
- 200 points for homework

Students need to collect at least 340 practice points. Only the students who scored 340~400 practice points are entitled to be graded. Students who did not earn 340 practice points receive a fail grade
 
Theory points are collected as follows:
- Homework - 10%
- Midterm exam - 40%
- Final exam - 50%

**The final score for CS101 is determined entirely by the theory points.**

**You may get F if you failed to get enough theory points.**

**The practice points over 340 are ONLY qualification for grading.**

**Cheating is strongly forbidden.**

Cheating on homework or exams will give an F. 
Both copier and source provider will obviously get F grade.

**Note that if you look at other’s HW program code, it will be considered as cheating.**

Every student may receive letter grades (A-F), but will be allowed to choose S/U grading afterward.

### Waiver exam
In the first or the second week of the semester, we offer a "Waiver Exam", which students who have already learnt programming can take to fulfill the CS101 requirement. 
The exam will be 120 minutes of on-line programming, by using Elice platform. 
For the exam, you may refer lecture notes and simple Internet search, but you should not use any communicating software such as mail or messengers. 
If you pass the exam with a B- or better, you can choose to accept the score as your CS101 score, or to give up the score and take the CS101 course.
According to KAIST rule from ART, **only those who have never taken the CS101 can apply the waiver exam.**


### Repeating students (Course retake policy)
Students who have already taken advanced courses involving programming, and all students who are majoring in the following departments cannot retake CS101 if they have already passed CS101: School of Electrical Engineering, School of Computing, Information & Communications Engineering, and Industrial & Systems Engineering)
 
All repeating students cannot receive a grade better than A- by KAIST policy (and this applies even to students who entered KAIST before 2007).
  
### Literature
CS101 uses the following materials:
-	**Practical Programming**: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6 (3rd Edition) by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, and Jason Montojo, Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2017, ISBN 978-1680502688
    -	A Korean translation is also available (ISBN 978-8960771338)
-	**Robot lecture notes** Lecture notes to be used together with cs1robots.py.
-	**Photo processing lecture notes** Lecture notes to be used with cs1media.py.
-	**Tutorial for cs1graphics** (The original is [http://www.cs1graphics.org/](http://www.cs1graphics.org/).)

The slides used in the lectures will also be available online, and there will be slides for every lab session.
 
### Software
We will make use of the following freely available software: Python 3, PyCharm IDE, Python Imaging Library (Pillow), cs1graphics.py, cs1robots.py, and cs1media.py.

2021 Spring semester CS101 midterm exam would be done as an online programming exam at 2021.4.19 Mon 6:30PM.

Instructions & section assignments: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jJf2VgWJWspZLEYSzoEdq6xu66F_wzZsEQwWyweWTJU/edit?usp=sharing

Schedule

- 6:30 ~ 6:45 Access Elice, camera adjustment
- 6:45 ~ 7:00 Introduction
- 7:00 ~ 9:00 Main exam (We will check your ID and attendance during the exam)

Problems: 5 quizes, 4 programming tasks

Coverage: Lecture 1~6, homework 1~2 (whatever you have learned before the exam)

Screen/face sharing

During the exam, students should share there PC screen and face on the camera by accessing appropriate Elice page following the TAs' instructions, and it will be shown to only the TAs in charge.
For the students who have no camera on the PC, we will provide Zoom session.

How to use screen/face sharing feature of Elice:

(1) On the lecture list, go to the 'Midterm' and Start it.
(2) After you start, it will show the exam setup instructions. Check and proceed to next. You should be aware of the 'server time' and 'local time' would be slightly different, so please be careful with your time management.
(3) Select the Exam room according to your section assignment, and proceed to next.
(4) Turn on your camera and screen sharing, and proceed to next. Shared videos will be recorded to prevent cheating.
(5) You will see the instructions again, please check and wait until 7PM.
(6) Problems will be open from exactly 7PM. Do not refresh the page at 7PM, simply go into the problem and solve it.

Etc.

- While you are waiting for the exam to be started, TA may ask you to show your ID card or portal login page.
- Please be sure that you should 'submit' your code rather than simply 'run' it.
- No questions are allowed during the exam, but please use Ask Help button if you have urgent one.
- Shared screen/face may be recorded to reveal cheating, and it will be deleted right after we check it.
- It is allowed to utilize materials on Elice, Python official documentations, lecture notes, personal notes, simple googling, most of other features except the messengers that might be regarded as cheating.
- Local IDEs such as PyCharm and IDLE are allowed, but we recommend you to use Elice to avoid the environment-problems, while grading will be done in Elice.

Rehearsal

We will do rehearsal of the midterm exam at 4/15 Thursday from 6:30PM to 7:10PM.
Please come and join the practice to avoid any exceptions at the midterm.
