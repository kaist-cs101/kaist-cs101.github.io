> The objective of CS101 is to teach *programming skills* and *computational thinking*. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.

### Course Objective
The objective of CS101 is to teach *programming skills* and *computational thinking*. Programming skills are essential because programming is a fundamental tool across all areas of science and engineering. Computational thinking is even more critical, as it shapes the way problems are approached and solved. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula; today, it is typically an algorithm.
 
### Course Structure
Since spring 2010, CS101 has used **Python**, a programming language *designed for ease of learning*. Python is widely adopted by universities around the world for *teaching introductory programming*. It is free, open-source, and multi-platform.
 
*Python is not a toy*. Python is the basis for much of the programming at Google (for instance, Python is the original and main framework for the Google App Engine platform). Python is used intensively in numerical computations, for instance at NASA. The *numerical Python* library supports vectorization and is widely used in scientific computation. Python is also the language of choice for writing user interfaces for applications on high-end Nokia phones. Large portions of games (such as Civilization IV) are written in Python. Python is becoming the language of choice in mathematics, used for instance by graph algorithm libraries, or the open-source mathematics software system Sage (an open-source competitor to Maple or Mathematica).
 
**Section and Lecture.** CS101 consists of about 500 students. All sections take offline lectures, which is once a week for 60~120 minutes. In addition, the Korean version of the CS101 lectures is available in KOOC (KAIST Massive Open Online Courses): https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101. These lectures would be helpful for those who have difficulties in taking the English lectures.

**Lecture Attendance Check.** Students must access the QR code on the right of the seat and submit the form from 10:15 to 10:45. TA will check for empty seats at a random time after the start of class. Attendance will be regarded as absent, when two or more students use the same QR code, student use the QR code of empty seats, or student take a seat without a QR code. If there is a network issue to access QR code, student must send a mail to head TA until 12:00 with a photo with clock, seat QR code, and class presentation screen. If student want to claim their attendance record, student must send a mail to head TA in 6 days after the class.

**Lab Session.** Each section meets once a week for a *three-hour lab session* supervised by a *head TA*, with some *helper TA*'s around. 
Students need to attend the lab session every week. One of the tasks done during the lab has to be marked off by a TA, so that we know that you were there and did your best.
 
**Homework.** There will also be four take-home assignments where you have to program slightly more complex tasks.
  
**Elice.** We will also make use of the online programming education platform, ~[Elice](https://kaist.elice.io/courses/)~. Elice contains lecture notes, codes, slides, programming tasks, and exams for CS101. **We will not use KLMS**

**Course Website.** The comprehensive course website (http://cs101.kaist.ac.kr/) contains the syllabus and links to all the software you need in the labs (or to do the lab tasks on your own computer). All other information, such as professors, TAs, and schedules can be found on the course website as well.

### Grading
CS101 grading consists of two parts: practice and theory.
 
Practice points are collected as follows:
- 100 points for lecture attendance
- 100 points for lab work
- 150 points for homework

Students need to collect at least 300 practice points. Only the students who scored 340~400 practice points are entitled to be graded. Students who did not earn 250 practice points receive a fail grade.
 
Theory points are collected as follows:
- Midterm exam - 40%
- Final exam - 60%

Theory Points Cut for
- NR (or D+) - 40
- F - 20

**The final score for CS101 is determined entirely by the theory points.**

**The practice points over 300 are ONLY qualifications for grading.**

**Cheating is strongly forbidden.** Cheating on homework or exams will give an F. Both the copier and source provider will obviously get an F grade. **Note that if you look at another’s HW or Lab program code, it will be considered cheating.**

**Using ChatGPT or AI-assisted tools will be considered cheating.** If you use any of the IDEs, you will get an F grade.

Every student will receive a letter grade (A-F).

### Pass exam
In the first week of the semester, we offer a "Pass Exam," which students who have already learned programming can take to fulfill the CS101 requirement.
**For this fall semester, the exam will be held at September 8th, 19:15. The place is TBD.**

The pass exam consists of a 120-minute programming exam that covers programming in Python as taught in CS101.
Note that the pass exam can consists of CS101 modules like cs1robots, cs1media, and cs1graphics modules.

The programming exam is open book and open google.
If you pass the exam with a B- or better, you can choose to accept the score as your CS101 score or to give up the score and take the CS101 course.
You can find more information about the pass exam on the KAIST portal’s announcement board.
According to the KAIST rule from ART, **only those who have never taken the CS101 can apply for the waiver exam.**
If you need more information about pass exam, please mail to ART.

After the pass exam enrollment, representative head TA will send you a mail with detailed instructions.

### Repeating students (Course retake policy)
Students who have already taken advanced courses involving programming and all students who are majoring in the following departments cannot retake CS101 if they have already passed CS101: School of Electrical Engineering, School of Computing, Information & Communications Engineering, and Industrial & Systems Engineering.

All repeating students cannot receive a grade better than A- by KAIST policy.

For those who have questions about retaking, please mail to Seong Hee Kang, [diane813@kaist.ac.kr](mailto:diane813@kaist.ac.kr) of the School of Computing office.
