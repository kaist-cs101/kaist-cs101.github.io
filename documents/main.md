## (2026 Spring) CS.10001 Introduction to Programming

> The objective of CS.10001 is to teach *programming skills* and *computational thinking*. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula. Today, it is usually an algorithm.

### Course Objective
The objective of CS.10001 is to teach *programming skills* and *computational thinking*. Programming skills are essential because programming is a fundamental tool across all areas of science and engineering. Computational thinking is even more critical, as it shapes the way problems are approached and solved. Fifty years ago, the solution to a problem in mathematics or engineering was often a formula; today, it is typically an algorithm.
 
### Course Structure
Since spring 2010, CS.10001 has used **Python**, a programming language *designed for ease of learning*. Python is widely adopted by universities around the world for *teaching introductory programming*. It is free, open-source, and multi-platform.
 
*Python is not a toy*. Python is the basis for much of the programming at Google (for instance, Python is the original and main framework for the Google App Engine platform). Python is used intensively in numerical computations, for instance at NASA. The *numerical Python* library supports vectorization and is widely used in scientific computation. Python is also the language of choice for writing user interfaces for applications on high-end Nokia phones. Large portions of games (such as Civilization IV) are written in Python. Python is becoming the language of choice in mathematics, used for instance by graph algorithm libraries, or the open-source mathematics software system Sage (an open-source competitor to Maple or Mathematica).
 
**Section and Lecture.** CS.10001 consists of about 500 students. All sections take offline lectures, which is once a week for 60~120 minutes. In addition, the Korean version of the CS.10001 lectures is available in [KOOC (KAIST Massive Open Online Courses)](https://kooc.kaist.ac.kr/cs101). These lectures would be helpful for those who have difficulties in taking the English lectures.

**Lab Session.** Each section meets once a week for a *three-hour lab session* supervised by a *head TA*, with some *helper TA*’s around (undergraduate students). Students need to attend the lab session every week. One of the tasks done during the lab has to be marked off by a TA so that we know that you were there and did your best.

**Homework.** There will also be one course criteria-based simple quiz assignment, and four take-home assignments where you must program slightly more complex tasks.

**Elice.** We will also make use of the online programming education platform, [Elice](https://kaist.elice.io/courses/768539). Elice contains lecture notes, codes, slides, programming tasks, and exams for CS.10001. **We will not use KLMS. Therefore, you should register the Elice.**

**Course Website.** The comprehensive [course website](http://cs101.kaist.ac.kr/) contains the syllabus and links to all the software you need in the labs (or to do the lab tasks on your own computer). All other information, such as professors, TAs, and schedules can be found on the course website as well.

### Grading
CS.10001 grading consists of two parts: practice and theory.
 
Practice points are collected as follows:
- 100 points for lecture attendance
- 100 points for lab work
- 50 points for course criteria-related homework(during the second week of semester)
- 100 points for homework

Students need to collect at least 300 practice points. Only the students who scored 300~350 practice points are entitled to be graded. Students who did not earn 300 practice points receive a fail grade.
 
Theory points are collected as follows:
- Midterm exam - 40%
- Final exam - 60%

Theory Points Cut for
- NR (or D+) - 40
- F - 20

**The final score for CS.10001 is determined entirely by the theory points.**

**The practice points over 300 are ONLY qualifications for grading.**

**Cheating is strongly forbidden.** Cheating on homework or exams will give an F. Both the copier and source provider will obviously get an F grade. **Note that if you look at another’s HW or Lab program code, it will be considered cheating.**

**Using ChatGPT, AI-assisted tools, or any personal IDEs(e.g. Pycharm, VSCode, Web IDEs like W3schools) will be considered cheating.**

Every student will receive a letter grade (A-F).

### Attendance Check

**Lecture Attendance Check.** Attendance is checked by two methods, and students should satisfy both methods. 

- Students must access the QR code on the right of the seat (for E11 Turman Hall) or the back of the seat (for E11 Room 304) and submit the form from 10:15 to 10:45. If there is a network issue to access QR code, student must send a mail to head TA until 12:00 with a photo with clock, seat QR code, and class presentation screen.
- TA will take a photo of the classroom and check for empty seats at a random time after the start of class.

Attendance will be regarded as absent, when two or more students use the same QR code, student use the QR code of empty seats, or student take a seat without a QR code. If student want to claim their attendance record, student must send a mail to representative head TA in 6 days after the class.

**Lab Attendance Check.** Lab attendance is granted only when you (1) complete the lab practice, (2) receive a check/verification from the TA, and (3) sign the attendance sheet in the presence of the TA. If you do not sign the attendance sheet, your attendance will not be recorded, even if you participated. Students who arrive more than 15 minutes late will not be allowed to enter the lab session.

If you cannot attend your scheduled lab session, or if you expect that you will be unable to attend, you may make up the lab by attending another lab session. A valid make-up lab will earn 5 Practice points.  A make-up lab will be counted only if you attend a lab session covering the same content. Attending a lab session that is covering different content/progress will not be counted as a make-up. The same late policy applies to make-up labs: if you arrive more than 15 minutes late, you will not be allowed to participate. If student want to claim their attendance record, student must send a mail to lab head TA in 6 days after the class.

**Approved Absence.** Approved absences are recognized only for the following reasons: 1) menstrual leave, 2) military service, 3) illness, 4) family events, 5) business trips, and 6) requests from university offices (excluding festivals).

Menstrual leave must be requested through the KAIST system. If a Lecture and Lab are scheduled on the same day, only the Lecture will be excused.

All excused absences except menstrual leave must be requested via a Google Form (to be announced later). You must also submit the original documents to Room 522, Building N1. For all other excused absences, if a Lecture and Lab are scheduled on the same day, both the Lecture and the Lab will be excused. 

- Military Service. You must submit an official participation/attendance confirmation.
- Illness. Only the following documents are accepted:
  - An medical certificate issued for the class date, or
  - An hospitalization certificate that includes the class date.
  - Prescriptions and medical receipts/billing statements are not accepted.
- Family Events
  - Marriage(self): 5 days from the marriage date, requires wedding invitation.
  - Childbirth(self or spouse): 20 days from the birth date, requires birth certificate, (with certificate of family relations, if spouse)
  - Bereavement:
    - Spouse; parent(s) of self or spouse: 5 days from the date of bereavement.
    - Grandparent(s) of self or spouse; children and children’s spouses; siblings of self or spouse: 3 days from the date of bereavement.
  - Requires death certificate and family relationship certificate
- Business Trips: Must be requested via the KAIST ERP system, and you must attach the approved travel request form (with final approval completed).
- Requests from University Offices: You must attach official proof of participation bearing the department office seal/stamp of the relevant university office.


### Pass exam
In the first week of the semester, we offer a "Pass Exam," which students who have already learned programming can take to fulfill the CS.10001 requirement.
**For this spring semester, the exam will be held at March 4th, 19:15. The place is E11 Room 307.**

The pass exam consists of a 120-minute programming exam that covers programming in Python as taught in CS.10001. Note that the pass exam can consists of CS.10001 modules like cs1robots, cs1media, and cs1graphics modules.

If you pass the exam with a B- or better, you can choose to accept the score as your CS.10001 score or to give up the score and take the CS.10001 course.
You can find more information about the pass exam on the KAIST portal’s announcement board.
According to the KAIST rule from ART, **only those who have never taken the CS.10001 can apply for the waiver exam.**
If you need more information about pass exam, please mail to ART.

After the pass exam enrollment, representative head TA will send you a mail with detailed instructions.

### Repeating students (Course retake policy)
Students who have already taken advanced courses involving programming and all students who are majoring in the following departments cannot retake CS.10001 if they have already passed CS.10001: School of Electrical Engineering, School of Computing, Information & Communications Engineering, and Industrial & Systems Engineering.

All repeating students cannot receive a grade better than A- by KAIST policy.
